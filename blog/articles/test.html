Greek scholarly mathematics changed ancient mathematical thinking and
how it challenged the status quo of political debate</h1>
<p>Ancient mathematics of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India, which preceded
Greek scholarly mathematics, was practically oriented. It was done by
accountants, land surveyors, and architects. These practical
mathematicians were primarily interested in results of measurements and
algorithms. While the masters in those fields surely had an intuition
and understanding as to why their algorithms and abstractions worked,
proofs of correctness were accepted via real-world experience and
empirical evidence. That is why they had no need for theoretical proofs
based on axioms.</p>
<p>Greek scholarly mathematics brought a shift to this way of thinking.
The predominant mathematics done was still practical mathematics, but
with Hippocrates of Chios a new tradition of mathematics started. Greek
scholarly mathematics focused on doing mathematics for the sake of doing
mathematics and on searching for truth. To convince others of their
discovered truths, Greek mathematicians would rely heavily on diagrams.
These were meant to guide readers from fundamental statements that were
known and accepted to be true to the statements to be proved. Readers
would be able to take these imprecise diagrams and abstract them in
their minds to an idealized image. The writing style accompanying these
diagrams was reflective of the objectives of a scholarly mathematician:
it was simple and precise and written with grammar which highlighted the
intrinsic and fundamental correctness of the proof. What further set
scholarly mathematics apart from practical mathematics was the omission
of numbers. The scholarly mathematicians saw numbers as imprecise, a
tool of the practical mathematicians that was used for measuring,
instead arguing with ratios. The correctness for these ratios would
follow from the written arguments and the diagrams. Euclid especially is
notable for his treatise “Elements” in which he lays the mathematical
foundational truths needed for more dazzling proofs.</p>
<p>Euclid’s argumentative framework is based on Aristotle’s more general
method of arguing. Socrates, and later his student Plato and in turn his
student Aristotle, challenged the political status quo of arguing which,
at the time, was about winning arguments rather than arguing for what
one believed to be the truth. Socrates famously died for this stance
rather than going into exile and Plato further criticized contemporary
Athenian rhetoric in his dialogue “Gorgias”. These rhetorical ideals
were formative to mathematical thinking and the modus operandi of
mathematical argumentation. Mathematicians had the same goal of arguing
that philosphers of the time were advocating: convincing of truth, not
debating for the sake of winning a debate. In turn, this mathematical
mode of arguing affected the methods of political discourse, attracting
the social elite of the time. What set mathematicians and philosophers
apart, though, was that philosophers struggled to reach concensus on
many topics, whereas mathematical knowledge was, for the most part,
accepted and agreed upon by the mathematicians.</p>
<p>While mathematics had been done for many centuries and in many
places, Greek scholarly mathematics, prodded by the political and
philosophical revolutions, sets itself apart from earlier mathematical
practices by forming a coherent school of thought, accompanied by
rigorous methodologies and a search for truth. Through the Greek
Miracle, mathematics was broadend from being a tool to be used in
practice to an abstract theoretical discipline as well.</p>
