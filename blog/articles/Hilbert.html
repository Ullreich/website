<h1 id="hilbert">Hilbert</h1>
<p>finitization of calculus and Arithmetization of mathematics:</p>
<ul>
<li>replacement of infinitesimals by epsilon-delta limit
definitions</li>
<li>axiomatic approaches to numbers</li>
<li>up until now a line was not a collection of points. Each of these
points can be identified with a number (see numberline)</li>
<li>acceptance of infinite sets</li>
<li>functions are thought of mappings from set a to set b (before then
it was lines) -&gt; gives new problematic (non-analytic) functions:
nowhere differentiable but continuous, nowhere continuous … (emergence
of monsters)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cantors-theory">Cantor’s theory</h3>
<p>fourier expansion is not changed by change in finite number of
places</p>
<p>Cantor tried to analyze which infinities would change fourier
expansion -&gt; there are different kinds of infinite.</p>
<p>This want to work with infinite set meant the analysation of infinite
sets and overcoming the challenges and paradoxes</p>
<h3 id="paradoxes-with-infinite-sets">Paradoxes with infinite sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>A</em>)</span> is always
larger than <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. What if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is the set of all sets?</li>
<li>Russell’s paradox: <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em> = {<em>X</em> : <em>X</em> ∉ <em>X</em>} ⇒ <em>B</em> ∈ <em>B</em> ≡ <em>B</em> ∉ <em>B</em></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-kantian-matrix">The Kantian Matrix</h3>
<p>Division of claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytic: The claim is true by definition/logic (e.g. if Sokrates is
a man and all men are mortal then Sokrates is mortal)</li>
<li>Synthetic: The definition/logic are not enough to justify the claim
(e.g. this bag is red)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as</p>
<ul>
<li>A-priori: The claim can be verified without external experience</li>
<li>A-posteriori: th claim requires external experience for
verification</li>
</ul>

<p>Kant says a claim can be both Synthetic and A-priori: the sum of a
triangles angles is 180 degrees. This is because a mathematical proof
does not follow by definition or logic (in his sense) but by the
construction of a mathematical proof. (This is not anymore a popular
approach but it was a popular approach during Hilbert’s time and
inspired him)</p>
<h3 id="hilberts-goals">Hilbert’s goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>infinite set theory</li>
<li>certainty/no paradoxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Finite arithmetic can be done by associating each numerical element
on one side with exactly one numerical elements on the other side</p>
<p>Non-finite statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><span
class="math inline">∀<em>a</em>, <em>b</em> ∈ ℕ : <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>a</em></span>
(not allowed for Hilbert, since it is an infinite set it doesn’t exist,
Hilbert allows potential infinite claims but not actually infinite
claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution: use idealized concepts: they don’t (necessarily )exist but
are useful. Mathematics already use idealized concepts such as imaginary
numbers. However, we can’t just introduce any idealized concept: it
can’t lead to any contradictions and needs to be successful. (He doesn’t
really explain what he means by successful, probs along the lines of
useful)</p>
<h3
id="how-do-you-prove-an-idealized-element-doesnt-lead-to-contradictions">How
do you prove an idealized element doesn’t lead to contradictions?</h3>
<p>Need to avoid <span class="math inline">1 ≠ 1</span></p>
<p>Three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>finite layer: <br>
<ul>
<li>refers to reality</li>
<li>The basis of mathematics for Hilbert is the givenness of human
reason and correlating symbols. managed by immediate intuition
concerning symbols</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ideal/formal layer: <br>
<ul>
<li>managed by axioms and rules that aply to the ideal elements</li>
<li>does not refer to anything</li>
<li><span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>a</em></span>
is still a meaningful statement when replacing a and b with a
number.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>metamathematical layer: <br>
<ul>
<li>think about this: <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>a</em></span>
as: symbols from direct experience (a.k.a a number)</li>
<li>refers to proffs in layer 2</li>
<li>managed by immediate intuition concerning symbols</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Goal: Prove in level 3 that layer 2 produces no contradiction</p>
<p>Gödel shows (using only the safe/finite layer which he needs to
assume to be good and given) that infinite mathematics is inconsistent
(Gensen shows consistency given some infinity, not super popular
tho)</p>
