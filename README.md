# My personal website

# TODO:
* rewrite main page
* write css for main page
* figure our licensing stuff
* since eleventy can't convert latex math in markdown to html anyway just rebase the whole thing and do it with pandoc probs

# How To:
`pandoc <markdown file> -s -o <html file> --css=<path to css>`
NB: '--css' needs the relative path on the website
